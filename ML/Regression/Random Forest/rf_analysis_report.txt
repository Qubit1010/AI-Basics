RANDOM FOREST REGRESSION - SOLAR FARM ENERGY PRODUCTION
================================================================================

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE
================================================================================
Predict daily solar farm energy production based on environmental conditions.

Why Random Forest for Solar Energy?
  • Multiple interacting factors (weather, seasonal, equipment)
  • Non-linear relationships (cloud cover impact varies by irradiance)
  • Need robust predictions (extreme weather outliers)
  • Ensemble reduces overfitting vs single tree
  • Feature importance reveals key production drivers

   • Each tree sees random features at each split
   • Final prediction = average of all 200 trees
   • Result: More stable, robust predictions

2. REDUCED OVERFITTING
   • Single tree overfitting: 0.4275
   • Random Forest overfitting: 0.1691
   • Improvement: 0.2584 reduction

3. BETTER ACCURACY
   • Single tree Test R²: 0.5714
   • Random Forest Test R²: 0.8046
   • Improvement: 40.81%

4. ROBUST TO OUTLIERS
   • Extreme weather days don't dominate single tree
   • Ensemble averaging smooths out anomalies
   • More reliable predictions in variable conditions

5. FEATURE IMPORTANCE RELIABILITY
   • Single tree: Feature importance varies with random seed
   • Random Forest: Averaged across 200 trees
   • More trustworthy insights for business decisions
