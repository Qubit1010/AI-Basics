MAE: $1,476.46

Model Equation:
Salary = $82,166.67 - 82943.997656 × Level^1 + 65896.401507 × Level^2 - 24381.956583 × Level^3 + 4929.086538 × Level^4 - 495.432692 × Level^5 + 19.791667 × Level^6

Improvement over Linear:
  R² improvement: +49.46%
  RMSE improvement: +98.76%

Interpolation Example:
  Level 6.5 (between Region Manager and Partner)
  Predicted Salary: $174,192.82

  This is useful for:
    • Negotiating salaries for new positions
    • Planning compensation for intermediate roles
    • Ensuring pay equity across levels

RESIDUAL ANALYSIS
================================================================================
Mean residual: $-0.00 (should be close to $0)
Std of residuals: $2,018.78
Max absolute error: $4,110.72

Residual Pattern:
  ✓ Residuals randomly distributed - model assumptions met

KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================================
✓ Salary Growth Pattern:
  - Non-linear (exponential) growth at senior levels
  - Entry level to mid-level: Steady increase
  - Senior to C-level: Dramatic acceleration
  - CEO salary is 22.2x entry level

✓ Model Performance:
  - Polynomial degree 6 captures the curve perfectly
  - 99.99% of salary variance explained
  - Average prediction error: only $1,476.46

✓ Why Polynomial Works Better:
  - Captures exponential growth at senior levels
  - Linear model assumes constant increase per level
  - Reality: Each level jump increases by larger amounts

BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================
1. SALARY STRUCTURE PLANNING
   Use the polynomial model to:
   • Set competitive salaries for each level
   • Ensure smooth progression between levels
   • Justify compensation decisions with data

2. RECRUITMENT & RETENTION
   • Predict fair offers for candidates at any level
   • Identify underpaid positions (actual < predicted)
   • Benchmark against market standards

3. CAREER PATH TRANSPARENCY
   • Show employees expected salary progression
   • Motivate career advancement with clear targets
   • Demonstrate value of promotions

4. BUDGET FORECASTING
   • Accurately project salary costs for workforce planning
   • Model impact of promotions on overall compensation
   • Plan for executive compensation growth

5. PAY EQUITY ANALYSIS
   • Use model as baseline for fair compensation
   • Identify anomalies (outliers from model)
   • Ensure consistent pay structure across organization

PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
================================================================================
Example Questions the Model Can Answer:

Q1: What should we offer a Level 4.5 candidate?
A1: Predicted salary: $92,881.27

Q2: Is $175,000 fair for Level 6.5?
A2: Model predicts $174,192.82 - Above model

Q3: What's the salary jump from Level 7 to 8?
A3: $300,000 - $200,000 = $100,000
