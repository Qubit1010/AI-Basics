K-MEANS CLUSTERING - URBAN AIR QUALITY MONITORING STATIONS
================================================================================

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE
================================================================================
Group 400 air quality sensors into pollution zone clusters based on their
multi-pollutant signatures, enabling the environmental agency to:
  - Issue targeted health alerts by zone type (not city-wide blankets)
  - Deploy field inspection teams to highest-risk industrial/traffic zones
  - Understand dominant pollution sources district by district
  - Track seasonal cluster shifts (winter heating changes residential profile)

WHY K-MEANS FOR AIR QUALITY STATIONS?
  - Unsupervised: no prior zone labels needed
  - Multi-pollutant fingerprint naturally groups by pollution source
  - Centroids = average pollution signature = actionable threshold per zone
  - Re-cluster monthly/seasonally to detect changing patterns
  - Scalable to city-wide networks of thousands of sensors

HEALTH RISK SCORES
================================================================================
  Industrial Zone       : 3721/100  [CRITICAL]
  Residential Burning   : 3220/100  [CRITICAL]
  Traffic Hotspot       : 2881/100  [CRITICAL]
  Clean Background      : 712/100  [CRITICAL]

POLLUTION SOURCE SIGNATURES
================================================================================
  Traffic Hotspot:
    Key markers: NO2 high (exhaust), BlackCarbon high (diesel),
                 CO elevated, low NightDayRatio (dies at night)
    Source:      Highways, intersections, bus depots

  Industrial Zone:
    Key markers: SO2 very high (coal/fossil fuel), VOC high (solvents),
                 PM10 high (grinding/dust), NightDayRatio ~1.0 (24/7 ops)
    Source:      Factories, power plants, chemical plants

  Residential Burning:
    Key markers: NightDayRatio > 1.0 (evening/overnight peak),
                 PM2.5 high (wood smoke), CO high (incomplete combustion)
    Source:      Cooking fires, heating stoves, residential boilers

  Clean Background:
    Key markers: All pollutants low, O3 slightly elevated (no NOx to consume),
                 High wind speed (open areas disperse pollution)
    Source:      Parks, forests, low-density suburbs

OPERATIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================
  [Industrial Zone — CRITICAL risk]
    1. Daily automatic alerts to nearby residents on high-SO2 days
    2. Dispatch inspection team if SO2 > 60 ppb for 3+ consecutive days
    3. Cross-reference with factory operating schedules
    4. Push for industrial scrubber compliance checks

  [Residential Burning — HIGH risk]
    1. Evening air quality alerts (5pm-9pm) to affected neighborhoods
    2. Winter coal/wood burning incentive programs for cleaner alternatives
    3. Work with housing authority on heating system upgrades
    4. NightDayRatio > 1.8 triggers automatic advisory

  [Traffic Hotspot — HIGH risk]
    1. Real-time NO2 display boards at major intersections
    2. Coordinate with traffic management for bus-priority signal timing
    3. School zone alerts when NO2 > 80 ppb during school hours
    4. Long-term: flag for EV charging infrastructure priority zones

  [Clean Background — LOW risk]
    1. Maintain as baseline reference sensors for the city
    2. Use as control group for pollution dispersion modeling
    3. Annual calibration checks sufficient
    4. Protect from development that could shift cluster

K-MEANS SPECIFIC NOTES FOR THIS SCENARIO
================================================================================
  - NightDayRatio was the KEY feature separating Residential from Traffic
    Without scaling, this 0-2 range feature would be invisible to K-Means
  - SO2 was the clearest Industrial Zone separator (very low in all others)
  - K=4 aligns perfectly with 4 known urban pollution source archetypes
  - Seasonal re-clustering essential: winter heating inflates Residential cluster
  - Sensors near cluster boundaries (low silhouette) warrant physical inspection
