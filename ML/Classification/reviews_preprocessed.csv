Hence, I will appreciate it if the tutors showcase themselves as we move through the courses.

Introduction to Data and Data Science,Dispelling Common Misconceptions,4,"I liked the videos.
They kept me engaged throughout the short course, providing bite-sized notes aided by images of the application of the different technical concepts.

The explanation is very good, simple choice of words, with clarification of technical terms, covering differences and similarities between the various concepts.
As accustomed as I am to hard paper studying, I tend to do a lot of transcription and paraphrases to present differences and similarities between concepts myself.
In these Videos, they highlight the keywords and link them for you.

On the other hand, Some flaws I identified are in the degree of the explanation. They were conveyed quite swiftly, and a bit shallowly I would say, yet as it is mentioned in the title (Introduction), you shouldn't expect in-depth coverage of the concept, but just a presentation of the key ideas and terminology you will encounter in the full career path.

Hence, For the points that I have stated, I think is already a good incipit, thus I wouldn't put it down as much, and although it may seem tedious from an outside view, I can assure you it's worth all of its time.
I recommend it !!! ","i liked the videos.

Probability,Variations without Repetition,5,"This as well as the other courses I'm taking are just marvellous. I love the idea of having to answer questions after the explication of a major concept. This is an effort on the part of the 365 D.S team to ensure that I'm following along with the proper, requisite understanding for the next topics.
Also, I like how everything is not given to me during the lesson and I'm constantly being reminded to do my own research, check the python documentation etc, and create and solve my own problems. I think it's a great way to make me a proactive learner. 
I'm a final-year computer engineering student who's been taking the data analysis course for a month now and I can definitely envision my ignorance in data science on its way to Calvary to be crucified, thanks to the D.S 365 team.

Given I didn't know what to expect, and a complete newbie to this, I felt this would be a good investment. While in some respects it has been, I did find it wasn't entirely beginner friendly. Some concepts were not properly explained, while some were glossed over(i.e null hypothesis). Given what I've had to learn in other places, I just felt it wasn't done well here. Sometimes it made me question myself when in fact it wasn't entirely my fault. 

I was very dissatisfied with its delivery as I could tell the author of the course wasn't thinking about his/her audience. If the author indeed was then the course clearly isn't for me; I am not confident recommending it to friends as their money will be best spent elsewhere as total newbies. It has led me to approach other courses in the career track with a bit of apprehension, thus forcing me to supplement them with other resources elsewhere on the internet.

The Machine Learning Process A-Z,Conclusion,5,"This course literarily saves me dozens of hours of time from watching various YouTube videos and looking up codes on the Internet. You’d find this course useful whether you’re doing your first portfolio project, or you’re a working professional. 

The companion notebooks and GitHub repo are golden! In the past, it took me dozens of hours to google the exact same thing on specific codes. Jeff and Ken did most of the heavy lifting for you, so that you can focus on working on your projects. 

Most importantly, Jeff has worked in well-known and reputable companies. So you know that his content and material are trustworthy. Though there’re a lot of “Kaggle Champions” on YouTube giving a walk-through on an ML project, I value that Jeff and Ken’s teaching a lot because of his years of experience in major tech companies.

This course stands out to me because it talks about the end-to-end process of building ML models. 
This is a topic that even some bootcamps don’t talk about it a lot. They either don’t spend much time to talk about it thoroughly, or they gloss over it, or they assume that “you would figure it out” along the way. 
So this course solves that problem to give you a walk through on that process. 

You would notice that each lecture video’s length is about several minute long to keep it bite-sized. 
And the coding notebook walkthrough videos are also thorough to cover the lecture video’s portions. 
So you’ll get both the theoretical knowledge and practical experience in this case. 

After watching this course, you should be able to do a Machine Learning project from start to finish, end-to-end all by yourself. 

I look forward to the Part 2 of the course – Machine Learning Algorithms with Jeff Li and Ken Jee.","this course literarily saves me dozens of hours of time from watching various youtube videos and looking up codes on the internet. you’d find this course useful whether you’re doing your first portfolio project, or you’re a working professional.
