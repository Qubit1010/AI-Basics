LOGISTIC REGRESSION FROM SCRATCH - PROJECT REPORT
======================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
======================================================================
Objective: Classify students as PASS or FAIL based on study hours
Algorithm: Logistic Regression (implemented from scratch)
Dataset: 100 students

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
======================================================================
• Sigmoid Activation Function
• Binary Cross-Entropy Loss
• Gradient Descent Optimization
• Learning Rate: 0.1
• Training Iterations: 1000

DATA SUMMARY
======================================================================
Total Students: 100
  Passed: 48 (48.0%)
  Failed: 52 (52.0%)

Training Set: 80 students (80%)
Test Set: 20 students (20%)

LEARNED PARAMETERS
======================================================================
Weight: 1.0845
Bias: -5.0718

Model Equation:
  P(Pass) = sigmoid(1.0845 × study_hours + -5.0718)

Interpretation:
  • Each additional hour of study increases the log-odds of passing
  • Positive weight means more study hours → higher pass probability

MODEL PERFORMANCE
======================================================================
Accuracy: 0.9500 (95.00%)
Precision: 0.9167
Recall: 1.0000
F1-Score: 0.9565

Confusion Matrix:
                Predicted FAIL  Predicted PASS
  Actual FAIL          8               1   
  Actual PASS          0               11  

Results:
  • Correct predictions: 19/20
  • Incorrect predictions: 1/20

SAMPLE PREDICTIONS
======================================================================
Study Hours    Prediction    Pass Probability
---------------------------------------------
     1.0          FAIL            1.8%
     3.0          FAIL           14.0%
     5.0          PASS           58.7%
     7.0          PASS           92.5%
     9.0          PASS           99.1%

KEY INSIGHTS
======================================================================
• Students who study more hours are more likely to pass
• The model learned a sigmoid curve that fits the data well
• Decision boundary is around 4.7 hours of study
• Model converged successfully with decreasing loss

HOW LOGISTIC REGRESSION WORKS
======================================================================
1. Linear Combination: z = weight × input + bias
2. Sigmoid Function: σ(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))
3. Output: Probability between 0 and 1
4. Classification: If probability ≥ 0.5 → Class 1 (PASS)
                  If probability < 0.5 → Class 0 (FAIL)

MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION
======================================================================
• Sigmoid maps any value to (0, 1) range
• Binary Cross-Entropy loss measures prediction quality
• Gradient Descent minimizes loss by adjusting weights
• Converges to optimal parameters that best fit the data
