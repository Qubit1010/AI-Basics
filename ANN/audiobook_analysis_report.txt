Confusion Matrix:
                Predicted Won't Buy  Predicted Will Buy
  Actual Won't Buy        1181                 4   
  Actual Will Buy         131                  93  

BUSINESS IMPACT ANALYSIS
================================================================================
Correctly identified non-buyers: 1181 customers
  → Advertising budget saved by not targeting these customers

Correctly identified buyers: 93 customers
  → Successfully targeted for retention campaigns

False positives: 4 customers
  → Wasted advertising on customers who won't buy
  → 0.34% of non-buyers incorrectly targeted

False negatives: 131 customers
  → Missed opportunity - these buyers weren't targeted
  → 58.48% of actual buyers missed

Advertising efficiency: 99.66%
  → Percentage of non-buyers correctly identified (saves ad spend)

Customer retention capture rate: 41.52%
  → Percentage of actual buyers successfully identified

TOP 5 MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES
================================================================================
Features that matter most for predicting customer repurchase:

1. Minutes_Listened: 0.4178
2. SupportRequests: 0.3849
3. BookLength_Sum_Minutes: 0.3685
4. Review_Score: 0.3546
5. Review: 0.3340

KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================================
✓ The model achieves 90.42% accuracy in predicting customer behavior
✓ 99.66% of non-buyers are correctly identified, saving ad budget
✓ 41.52% of actual buyers are captured for retention campaigns
✓ ROC-AUC of 0.871 indicates very good discrimination ability
✓ The most important predictive feature is: Minutes_Listened

RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================
1. TARGET CUSTOMERS WITH HIGH PROBABILITY
   Focus advertising budget on customers with >50% predicted probability
   of repurchase to maximize ROI

2. IMPROVE KEY METRICS
   Based on feature importance, prioritize improving:
   • Minutes_Listened
   • SupportRequests
   • BookLength_Sum_Minutes

3. MONITOR MODEL PERFORMANCE
   Regularly retrain with new data to maintain accuracy
   Current model should be updated quarterly

4. A/B TESTING
   Test the model's predictions against random targeting to measure
   actual advertising budget savings

5. PERSONALIZATION
   Use prediction probabilities to customize retention offers:
   • High probability (>0.7): Standard retention offer
   • Medium probability (0.5-0.7): Enhanced retention offer
   • Low probability (<0.5): Minimal/no advertising spend

COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS
================================================================================
Assuming:
  • Average advertising cost per customer: $10
  • Average revenue from repurchasing customer: $50
  • Total test set: 1409 customers

Without model (random targeting all customers):
  Cost: 1409 × $10 = $14,090
  Revenue: 224 × $50 = $11,200
  Net: $-2,890

With model (target only predicted buyers):
  Cost: 97 × $10 = $970
  Revenue: 93 × $50 = $4,650
  Net: $3,680

Savings: $13,120
Improvement: 227.3%
