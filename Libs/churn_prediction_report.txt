CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION - PROJECT REPORT
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================
Objective: Predict which customers are likely to churn (cancel service)
Dataset: 1000 customers with 7 features
Models Trained: 3 (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree)

DATA SUMMARY
================================================================================
Total Customers: 1000
Churned Customers: 380 (38.0%)
Active Customers: 620 (62.0%)

Training Set: 700 samples (70%)
Test Set: 300 samples (30%)

FEATURES
================================================================================
1. Age - Customer age (18-70 years)
2. Monthly Charges - Monthly bill amount ($20-$150)
3. Total Charges - Total amount paid over lifetime
4. Tenure Months - How long customer has been with company (1-72 months)
5. Contract Type - Month-to-month (0), One year (1), Two year (2)
6. Support Calls - Number of customer support calls
7. Data Usage GB - Monthly data usage (1-50 GB)

MODEL PERFORMANCE
================================================================================
1. Logistic Regression       Accuracy: 67.67%
2. Random Forest             Accuracy: 66.00%
3. Decision Tree             Accuracy: 62.67%

BEST MODEL: Logistic Regression
================================================================================
Accuracy: 67.67%

Confusion Matrix:
  True Negatives:  157 (Correctly predicted no churn)
  False Positives: 29 (Incorrectly predicted churn)
  False Negatives: 68 (Missed churn predictions)
  True Positives:  46 (Correctly predicted churn)

KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================================
• Churn rate is highest for month-to-month contracts
• Customers with short tenure are more likely to churn
• High monthly charges correlate with increased churn
• Frequent support calls indicate potential churn risk

BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================
1. Focus retention efforts on month-to-month contract customers
2. Engage with new customers early (first 12 months)
3. Monitor customers with high monthly charges
4. Improve customer support to reduce call frequency
5. Consider loyalty programs for long-tenure customers
